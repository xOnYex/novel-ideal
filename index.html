          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>
            Our mission is to encourage out-of-school reading among children and
            teenagers. In the modern world of internet and smartphones, the
            youth are increasingly hesitant to put down Twitter and pick up a
            book. We therefore encourage everyone to take a stand and push
            towards non-compulsory reading. The future of our society depends on
            eager-to-learn, literate young adults.

          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We're an organization founded in 2022 to promote the idea of reading
            for fun among children and teens. Our founder, Onyebuchi, was an
            avid reader as a kid - books like Harry Potter and Gregor the
            Overlander stole his attention away for hours. Now, he strives to
            give the youth the opportunity to do the same. To this end, he
            partnered with the
            <span class="link"
              ><a
                href="https://www2.ed.gov/readwhereyouare/index.html"

                >US Department of Education</a
              ></span
            >
            to create the #ReadWhereYouAre movement - just another step towards
            creating the novel ideal.

          <h1>Importance</h1>
          <p>
            Reading is an important skill to cultivate when one is young.
            Reading has been shown to increase creativity and attentiveness,
            both strong attributes to have in our increasingly bustling world.
            The act of simply stopping and reading can save one hours of work in
            an attempt to solve problems that are right in front of them.
            Therefore, we strive to increase the number of avid readers in the
            world, one kid at a time.
